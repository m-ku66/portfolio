    problemStatement:
      "My goal for this project was to teach users about ciphertext via some sort of interactive experience. What kind of experience would engage the user long enough to allow them to learn what I have to teach?",
    solution:
      "I decided that a gamified experience would be the best way to go about teaching since games are things that most people can enjoy. They also have the added benefit of being really good at keeping people's attention. My target audience for this project was anyone interested in puzzles as well, which encompasses a lot of people that have a high chance of liking games.",

    ],
    conclusion:
      "The gist is that I essentially made a 3D game environemnt that would require the user to look around and solve puzzles in order to proceed to the next 'level'. The puzzles are all based on very simple principles of ciphertext and yield explanations of their nature upon being completed, teaching the user while they play.",

    solution:
      "The solution we came up with was to create a puzzle/escape room game that would have an underwater theme and have one of the puzzles be loosely based on trivia relating to the character I made for the character viewer.

    solution:
      "I thought that the most simple solution would be to just create a character viewer that would let the user see all kinds of stuff about the character like stats, origin, attributes, etc. I decided to use Blender, the Google model-viewer tool, and vanilla html, CSS, and Javascript to create and display the character.",

    conclusion:
      "While I originally wanted the scope of the project to be larger and include things like a title and lobby screen, I began running out of time(mostly due to using a previous iteration of this project to teach myself React for the first time) and had to confine things to just the character screen and limit the interactability of the project overall, focusing more on visual appeal. However, I find the end result a decent depiction of character viewers popular in modern gacha games and mobile RPGs. The original React version of the project can be accessed via source files.",
